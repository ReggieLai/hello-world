# hello-world

Hi! 

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry at the University of British Columbia and am pursuing my second degree in Computer Science. So far I don't really know much about programming but I hope to change that soon with GitHub! I am looking forward to getting inspired from the various projects on this site.
